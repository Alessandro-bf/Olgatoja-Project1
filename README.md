        -   The two main colours used are OLGATOJA pink, and white.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Ubuntu font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Ubuntu is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The hero image is designed to show the simplicity of the Multi-Step Korean Routine. The set images are designed to show the products and make them available to the user. The design is also minimalist, attractive, and aesthetic.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.

        1. By entering the site, users are welcome to use a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath is a hero banner with a short description of the aim and benefits of the 10-step Korean Skincare Routine.
        2. The footer always shows the social media icons for YouTube and Instagram, where the user can learn more about the organisation.
        3. The About page introduces Olga and tells her story to engage with the users, encouraging them to go to social media to learn more.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.

        1. The site has been designed with some features to make it easy for the user to access. At the top of each page is a precise navigation bar; each link clearly describes the page they will end up at.
        2. At the footer of the three pages, there is a social media link to invite users to learn more about us.
        3. On the Ready-Made Sets Page, after a form response is submitted, the page refreshes, shows a message thanking the user for the order, and then, after 10 seconds, brings the user to the home page.

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to get to know the organisation and locate their social media links to see their followings to determine how trusted and known they are.

        1. Once the new visitor has read the About page and the easy steps of the Korean Routine, the user will go to the ready-made sets section and see the different products available to make the most of the routine.
        2. The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.
        3. At the bottom of the Ready Made Sets page, the user will find a form to order the sets with the recommended products.

-   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. The social media will be showing the lates news about the routine and the results.
        2. The new products will be updated with the ready-made sets offered on the webpage.

    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.

        1. The navigation bar clearly highlights the "About" Page and points to social media.

    3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the new products they offer.

        1. The Ready-made sets section shows the latest productos available to follow the routine acording to the goals and the results wanted for the user.
        2. Alternatively, the user can go to the social media and see the new products and how to use them.

-   #### Frequent User Goals

    1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added multi-step Korean routines.

        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily go to the home page and check.
