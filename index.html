                <h1>10-Step Korean Skincare Routine</h1>
                <p>The 10-Step isn't just a routine - it's a lifestyle inspired by Korea's love for healthy skin and
                    supported by many years of scientific research.</p>
                <br>
                <p>It's not about owning countless products, but about choosing the right ones and using them in the
                    correct
                    sequence, to achieve a dewy, ageless looking skin.</p>

                <li>
                    <h3>1. Oil Cleanser</h3>
                    <p>Oil cleansers are a skincare game-changer due to their ability to effectively remove all types of
                        makeup, sunscreen, and impurities without stripping the skin of its natural oils. They are
                        formulated with gentle oils that work to dissolve the oils on your skin, including sebum, which
                        can attract dirt and pollutants throughout the day.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>2. Water based Cleanser</h3>
                    <p>Following oil cleansing, water-based cleansers are integral to Korean skincare routine because
                        they use gentle formulas to remove remaining impurities, sweat, and residual oil without drying
                        out the skin. This step ensures thorough cleansing and preps the skin for subsequent treatments.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>3. Exfoliation</h3>
                    <p>Remove dead skin cells, revealing smoother, brighter skin by exfoliating. It can be achieved
                        through physical scrubs or chemical exfoliants like AHAs and BHAs. Regular exfoliation promotes
                        cell turnover, preventing clogged pores and enhancing product absorption.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>4. Toner</h3>
                    <p>Toner in Korean skincare rebalances skin pH after cleansing, preps for better product absorption,
                        and hydrates. It often contains botanical extracts to soothe and refine skin texture, promoting
                        a clear complexion.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>5. Essence</h3>
                    <p>This little known “layer” for Western consumers is a lightweight, hydrating formula packed with
                        active ingredients like hyaluronic acid and antioxidants. It penetrates deep into the skin to
                        nourish, brighten, and improve skin texture, enhancing overall complexion and preparing it for
                        subsequent treatments.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>6. Treatments</h3>
                    <p>By treatments we mean cosmetics which target specific concerns like acne, hyperpigmentation, or
                        aging. They include serums, ampoules, and masks enriched with potent ingredients such as vitamin
                        C, niacinamide, or peptides. Regular use addresses skin issues, promoting a healthier, more
                        radiant complexion.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>7. Sheet Mask</h3>
                    <p>Sheet masks are cloth masks soaked in nourishing serums. They provide intense hydration and
                        deliver active ingredients like hyaluronic acid and vitamins directly to the skin. Used
                        regularly, they boost hydration, brighten complexion, and address various skin concerns for a
                        rejuvenated appearance.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>8. Eye cream</h3>
                    <p>Target delicate under-eye area, combating dark circles, puffiness, and fine lines with eye cream.
                        Formulated with gentle yet potent ingredients like peptides and caffeine, it hydrates, firms,
                        and brightens the eye area for a refreshed look. Regular use promotes youthful, radiant eyes.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>9. Moisturiser</h3>
                    <p>Moisturisers seal in hydration, balance oil production, and form a protective barrier. They
                        usually have lightweight formulas, often infused with botanical extracts which replenish
                        moisture without clogging pores. Used day and night, it keeps skin soft, supple, and nourished,
                        enhancing overall complexion.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>10. Sun Protection</h3>
                    <p>Arguably the most important step of all, applying SPF prevents sun damage, premature aging, and
                        hyperpigmentation. Lightweight, non-greasy formulas with high UVA/UVB shields skin from harmful
                        UV rays. Regular use safeguards skin health and maintains a youthful complexion.</p>
                </li>
