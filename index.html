        <h1>6-Step Korean Skincare Routine</h1>
        <p>The 6-Step isn't just a routine - it's a lifestyle inspired by Korea's love for healthy skin and supported by years of scientific research.</p>
        <p>It's not about owning countless products, but about choosing the right ones and using them in the correct sequence, to achieve a dewy, ageless looking skin.</p>
